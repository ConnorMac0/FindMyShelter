Description
- The Find My Shelter system can provide an all-in-one view of what spaces are available for the unhoused and other information such as policies, accomidations, distance away from your location, and directions to the safe sleeping site.

- The site is currently used for proof of concept only, therefore is must be locally hosted and some of the data on the site, like spots available, are just dummy data examples and are not accurate.
